1000 cylinders,
10 sectors / track
HEAD AT cylinder 0
HEAD MOVES 10μs / cylinder
DISK ROTATES @ 100Hz

What is the average time to read a randomly chosen byte?

Solution
---

The time we are looking for is going to be the sum of the time that it takes the head to go to the right cylinder `Tcylinder` and then
the amount of time it has to wait for the right sector `Tsector` to come under the head.

Ttotal = Tcylinder + Tsector

Tcylinder is the time it takes to move the head to the average cylinder(500)

The head is initially at cylinder 0. We take (999 + 0) / 2 to be the average visited cylinder
Which means that the byte we have to read is at cylinder 500(rounded)

In order to move the head from cylinder 0 to cylinder 500 we will need
to move across 500 cylinders therefore it will take

    500 cylinders * 10μs / cylinder = 5000μs = 5ms

Tsector is the average time that it takes for the right sector to rotate under the head

Since there are 10 sectors let's assume an equal distribution between those,
with the average value being 5.
Waiting for 5 sectors out of 10 means waiting for half a rotation around the disk. We know that the disk
rotates at f=100Hz therefore one rotation happens in T = 1/f = 10ms, half of which is 5ms

Therefore the average time to read a randomly chosen byte is 10ms

Worst case scenario:

1000 cylinder -> 10ms
10 sectors -> 10 ms
Total: 20ms
